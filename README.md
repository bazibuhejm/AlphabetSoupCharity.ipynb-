Bek’s come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following: EIN and NAME—Identification columns APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification USE_CASE—Use case for funding ORGANIZATION—Organization type STATUS—Active status INCOME_AMT—Income classification SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following: Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)
